//Insertion Sort Algorithm - Short Definition:

//Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by taking one element from the input, placing it in the correct position relative to the already sorted part, and repeating this process for all elements.
//Key Points:
//* It works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
//* Best case (already sorted): O(n)
//* Worst and average case: O(nÂ²)
//* In-place and stable sorting algorithm

// Basic Steps:
//1 Start with the second element (index 1), assuming the first is already sorted.
//2 Compare it with the elements before it.
//3 Shift larger elements to the right.
//4 Insert the current element at the correct position.
//5 Repeat for all elements.
